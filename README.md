## Part 1 - Strings
Problem # | Solution | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
| 1. Are the letters unique?| [My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge1.playground)|Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string has only unique letters, taking letter case into account.|
| 2. Is a string a palindrome?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge2.playground)|Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string reads the same when reversed, ignoring case.|
| 3. Do two strings contain the same characters?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge3.playground)|Write a function that accepts two String parameters, and returns true if they contain the same characters in any order taking into account letter case.|
| 4. Does one string contain another?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge4.playground)|Write your own version of the contains() method on String that ignores letter case, and without using the existing contains() method.|
| 5. Count the characters|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge5.playground)|Write a function that accepts a string, and returns how many times a specific character appears, taking case into account.| 
| 6. Remove duplicate letters from a string|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge6.playground)|Write a function that accepts a string as its input, and returns the same string just withduplicate letters removed.|
| 7. Condense whitespace|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge7.playground)|Write a function that returns a string with any consecutive spaces replaced with a single space.| 
| 8. String is rotated|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge8.playground)|Write a function that accepts two strings, and returns true if one string is rotation of the other, taking letter case into account.|
| 9. Find pangrams|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge9.playground)|Write a function that returns true if it is given a string that is an English pangram, ignoring letter case.| 
| 10. Vowels and consonants|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge10.playground)|Given a string in English, return a tuple containing the number of vowels and consonants.|
| 11. Three different letters|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge11.playground)|Write a function that accepts two strings, and returns true if they are identical in length but have no more than three different letters, taking case and string order into account.| 
| 12. Find longest prefix|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge12.playground)|Write a function that accepts a string of words with a similar prefix, separated by spaces, and returns the longest substring that prefixes all words.|
