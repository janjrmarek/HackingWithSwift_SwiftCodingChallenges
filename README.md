## Part 1 - Strings
Problem # | Solution | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
| 1. Are the letters unique?| [My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge1.playground)|Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string has only unique letters, taking letter case into account.|
| 2. Is a string a palindrome?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge2.playground)|Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string reads the same when reversed, ignoring case.|
| 3. Do two strings contain the same characters?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge3.playground)|Write a function that accepts two String parameters, and returns true if they contain the same characters in any order taking into account letter case.|
| 4. Does one string contain another?|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge4.playground)|Write your own version of the contains() method on String that ignores letter case, and without using the existing contains() method.|
| 5. Count the characters|[My Solution](Part%201%20-%20String%20Solutions/Challenge5.playground)|Write a function that accepts a string, and returns how many times a specific character appears, taking case into account.|
